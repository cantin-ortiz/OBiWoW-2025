# Missing value imputation in methylation data
This workshop will teach you how to handle missing data values in your methylation data using R package methyLImp2. We will go over the types of missing values, consequences of doing (or not) missing value imputation and performance under different missing value patterns. We will also try out methyLImp2 package in action for some missing value imputation.
